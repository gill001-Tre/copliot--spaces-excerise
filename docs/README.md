## Summary of OctoAcme Project Management Processes
OctoAcme follows a structured, iterative lifecycle — **initiation → planning → execution → monitoring → closure** — with clear handoffs and checkpoints. Work is broken into shippable increments, and progress is tracked on boards.

**Roles & Responsibilities:** OctoAcme defines clear personas: **Project Manager**, **Product Manager**, **Developer**, **QA**, and **Stakeholder**. The Project Manager coordinates delivery, schedules, risk, and communication; the Product Manager prioritizes outcomes; Developers implement and test; QA validates acceptance and quality gates; Stakeholders provide direction, feedback, and approvals.

**Communication & Decision-Making:** Cadences include daily standups, weekly syncs, and milestone demos. Status, risks, and decisions are captured in issues and PRs; escalations follow a documented path from team leads to the Project Manager and, if needed, executive sponsors.

**Quality & Release:** Quality gates include code review, automated CI for builds/tests/lint, and acceptance criteria validation before merge. Releases follow a checklist with rollback plans, and post-release reviews drive continuous improvement.
